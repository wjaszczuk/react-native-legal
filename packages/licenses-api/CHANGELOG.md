### Major Changes

- [#209](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/pull/209) [`dd565f1`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/commit/dd565f196512cd63f22968631633c7920eb10ec0) Thanks [@wjaszczuk](https://github.com/wjaszczuk)! - Parse licenses as SPDX License Expressions. Classification follows the expression (`AND` takes the most restrictive operand, `OR` follows the new `--or-policy` option, `WITH` and `+` take the base license's category), unrecognised values are Unknown instead of permissive, and every license file of a package is collected. **Breaking:** `type`, `content` and `file` are removed from scanned entries and `report --format json`; use `rawLicense`, `license`, `licenseIds` and `licenseFiles`. `MIT OR GPL-3.0` style packages now fail `copyleft` by default; `--or-policy least-restrictive` restores the previous result. See the migration guide. `copyleft` also lists licenses that could hide copyleft because part of their expression is Unknown (`MIT AND LicenseRef-Custom`) in a warning, and the new opt-in `--error-on-unidentified` flag exits with code `3` for them; the other exit codes are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#173](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/pull/173) [`0017b28`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/commit/0017b28707c823add803c66a7905bf52dcb56ce2) Thanks [@mateusz1913](https://github.com/mateusz1913)! - Update dependencies (glob, next, commander)

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#169](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/pull/169) [`f300815`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/commit/f3008150b94e50cec30a2706bf63bfca956eefa4) Thanks [@alexisloiselle](https://github.com/alexisloiselle)! - Sanitize unsafe characters in `prepareAboutLibrariesLicenseField` so packages with legacy or compound SPDX expressions (e.g. `MIT/X11`, `(MIT OR Apache-2.0)`) no longer break the AboutLibraries metadata generation on Android. Previously the unsanitized `/` caused `writeAboutLibrariesNPMOutput` to attempt creating files like `android/config/licenses/MIT/X11_<hash>.json`, failing with `ENOENT` because `MIT/` was treated as a subdirectory.
